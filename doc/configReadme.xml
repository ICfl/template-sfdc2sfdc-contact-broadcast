As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize contacts between two Salesfoce orgs.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of Contact from one Salesforce instance to another. Everytime there is new contact or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in Salesforce source instance and it will be responsible for updating the Salesforce on the target org.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish a starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing) and [Outbound messaging](https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_om_outboundmessaging.htm)
The batch job is divided in Process and On Complete stages.
During the Input stage the Anypoint Template will go to the Salesforce Org A and query all the existing Contacts that match the filter criteria.
During the Process stage, each SFDC Contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching Contact in the SFDC Org B and if the last updated date of the contact from SFDC Org A is greater than the one in SFDC Org B(in case that the same contact already exists).
The last step of the Process stage will group the contacts and create/update them in SFDC Org B.
The integration could be also triggered by HTTP inbound connector defined in the flow that is going to trigger the application and executing the batch job with received message from Salesforce source instance.
Outbound messaging in Salesforce allows you to specify that changes to fields within Salesforce can cause messages with field values to be sent to designated external servers.
Outbound messaging is part of the workflow rule functionality in Salesforce. Workflow rules watch for specific kinds of field changes and trigger automatic Salesforce actions in this case sending contacts as an outbound message to Mule HTTP inbound connector,
which will then further process this message and creates Contacts in target Salesforce org.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. The application will poll Salesforce to know if there are any newly created or updated objects and synchronice them.

Once your app is all set and started, you will need to define Salesforce outbound messaging and a simple workflow rule. [This article will show you how to accomplish this](https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_om_outboundmessaging_setting_up.htm)
The most important setting here is the `Endpoint URL` which needs to point to your application running on Cloudbhub, eg. `http://yourapp.cloudhub.io:80`. Additionaly, try to add just few fields to the `Fields to Send` to keep it simple for begin.
Once this all is done every time when you will make a change on Account in source Salesforce org. This account will be sent as a SOAP message to the Http endpoint of running application in Cloudhub.

**Application configuration**

+ http.port `9090` 
+ page.size `190`
+ scheduler.frequency `60000`
+ scheduler.start.delay `0`
+ watermark.default.expression `YESTERDAY`
+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`
+ trigger.policy `push` | `poll`

**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the two following values: 

+ **empty_value**: if the propety has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the contact over.
+ **syncAccount**: it will try to create the contact's account when it is not pressented in the Salesforce instance B.

**Note:** the property **trigger.policy** can take any of the three following values:

+ **empty_value**: if the propety has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the contact over.
+ **poll**: the Scheduler trigger flow will be used
+ **push**: the Push Notification trigger flow will be used

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / 200***

Being ***X*** the number of Contacts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Contacts are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by one flow that will be responsible for Salesforce creations/updates. The several message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. During the Input stage the Anypoint Template will go to the Salesforce Org A and query all the existing Contacts that match the filter criteria.
2. During the Process stage, each SFDC contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching contact in the SFDC Org B.
3. The last step of the Process stage will group the contacts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.
4. Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

This is file is conformed by four flows.

The first one we'll call it **push** flow. This one contains an HTTP endpoint that will be listening for notifications from Salesforce . Each of them will be processed and thus update/create Contacts, and then executing the batch job process.

The second one we'll call it **scheduler** flow. This one contains the Scheduler endpoint that will periodically trigger **salesforceQuery** flow and then executing the batch job process.

The third one we'll call it **salesforceQuery** flow. This one contains watermarking logic that will be querying Salesforce for updated/created Contacts that meet the defined criteria in the query since the last polling. The last invocation timestamp is stored by using Objectstore Component and updated after each Salesforce query.

The fourth one we'll call it  **main** flow. This one executes the Batch Job which handles all the logic of it. This flow has Error Handling that basically consists on invoking the *On Error Propagate Component* defined in *errorHandling.xml* file.
